# IoT-Based Smart Helmet for Coal Mine Safety

## üìå Project Overview
This project is an **IoT-enabled smart helmet** designed to **enhance safety for coal mine workers**. It integrates **gas detection (MQ-2), temperature & humidity monitoring (DHT11), helmet compliance check, and obstacle detection (IR sensor)**. The system uses **ESP-NOW** for communication between transmitter and receiver ESP32 modules and connects to **Blynk IoT Cloud** for real-time monitoring. The helmet also includes **SOS alerts and buzzer warnings** to improve worker safety in hazardous environments.

## ‚úÖ Features
- **Gas Detection:** Detects harmful gases like methane, carbon monoxide, and smoke (MQ-2 sensor).
- **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring:** Tracks environmental conditions using the DHT11 sensor.
- **Helmet Compliance:** Ensures the helmet is worn using an IR sensor.
- **Obstacle Detection:** Alerts workers about obstructions.
- **Wireless Communication:** Uses **ESP-NOW protocol** for data transfer between ESP32 modules.
- **Cloud Connectivity:** Sends real-time data to **Blynk IoT Cloud** via Wi-Fi.
- **Live Monitoring & Alerts:** Displays real-time sensor readings on the **Blynk mobile app**.
- **Emergency SOS Signal:** Automatically triggers an alert if hazardous conditions are detected.
- **Buzzer Warning System:** Alerts users of dangerous conditions.

   - Receives sensor data from the transmitter ESP32.
   - Uploads data to **Blynk Cloud** for real-time monitoring.
   - Activates **buzzer warnings** if unsafe conditions are detected.

3. **Cloud Integration (Blynk IoT)**
   - Stores real-time sensor data.
   - Displays alerts and live monitoring dashboard.
