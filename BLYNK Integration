Blynk App Integration for IoT-Based Smart Helmet

Overview

Blynk is an IoT platform that allows real-time monitoring and control of your IoT devices using a mobile app. This guide will explain how to integrate the Blynk app with the smart helmet project to display sensor data, send alerts, and enable remote monitoring.

Prerequisites

Blynk App: Download and install the Blynk app from the Play Store or App Store.

Blynk Account: Create an account on Blynk.

Blynk Libraries: Install the required Blynk libraries in the Arduino IDE.

ESP32 Board Setup: Ensure your ESP32 is configured properly in Arduino IDE.

Wi-Fi Credentials: Keep your Wi-Fi SSID and password ready.

Steps to Integrate Blynk

1. Setting Up Blynk App

Open the Blynk app and create a new project.

Choose ESP32 as the hardware and Wi-Fi as the connection type.

An Auth Token will be sent to your registered email. Save this for later.

Add widgets to the app:

Label or Value Display for temperature, humidity, and gas levels.

LED Widget for alert notifications.

Button Widget to trigger emergency SOS alerts.

2. Installing Blynk Library

Open Arduino IDE and go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.

Search for Blynk and install the latest version.

Also, ensure you have installed WiFi.h and BlynkSimpleEsp32.h.

3. Connecting ESP32 to Blynk

Open the Transmitter.ino file in Arduino IDE.

Modify the code to include your Auth Token, Wi-Fi SSID, and Password:

#define BLYNK_PRINT Serial
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <BlynkSimpleEsp32.h>

char auth[] = "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN";
char ssid[] = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
char pass[] = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Blynk.begin(auth, ssid, pass);
}

void loop() {
  Blynk.run();
}

Upload this code to your ESP32 and open the Serial Monitor to check if the device is connected.

4. Sending Sensor Data to Blynk

Use virtual pins to send sensor data to the Blynk app.

Example code to send temperature data:

Blynk.virtualWrite(V0, temperatureValue);

Assign widgets in the Blynk app to the respective virtual pins.

5. Setting Up Alerts

Configure the Blynk app to send notifications when a threshold is exceeded.

Example code to trigger an alert:

if (gasLevel > threshold) {
    Blynk.notify("Warning! Gas levels high!");
}

6. Testing the System

Run the project and monitor the data in real time on the Blynk app.

Adjust sensor values and ensure the alerts and controls function properly.

Conclusion

With Blynk integration, the smart helmet can provide real-time monitoring and alerts for hazardous conditions in coal mines. This setup enables workers and supervisors to receive instant updates, improving overall safety and response time.
