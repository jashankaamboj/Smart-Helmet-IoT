# Required Libraries for IoT-Based Smart Helmet

## Core Libraries
- `WiFi.h` – Enables ESP32 to connect to the internet for Blynk IoT cloud integration.
- `ESPNow.h` – Used for ESP-NOW wireless communication between ESP32 modules.
- `BlynkSimpleEsp32.h` – Allows the ESP32 to communicate with the Blynk IoT Cloud.

## Sensor-Specific Libraries
- `DHT.h` – Library for reading temperature & humidity data from the **DHT11** sensor.
- `MQ2.h` – Required for gas detection using the **MQ-2** sensor.
- `IRremote.h` – Used for IR sensor-based helmet compliance and obstacle detection.

## Additional Utilities
- `ArduinoJson.h` – Useful for formatting data before sending it to the cloud (optional).
- `EEPROM.h` – If small amounts of sensor data need to be stored on ESP32.

## Installation Guide
1. Open **Arduino IDE**.
2. Go to **Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries**.
3. Search for each library name and click **Install**.

These libraries will ensure smooth operation of your IoT-based Smart Helmet project.
